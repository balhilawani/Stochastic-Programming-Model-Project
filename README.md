• Developed a Python code that implemented the simplex method, primal affine scaling algorithm, and industrial solver (linprog method) to solve the farming problem for various number of scenarios and compared their performance to one another.

• Achieved a 100% code accuracy rate for both methods when compared to an industrial solver (linprog function).
